# Dream Mod


> "I'm telling you, with cheaters [...] they will never admit. I guarantee you that he will die on a stone swearing up and down on his momma and his life that he did not cheat on this run. And the same thing that Drem did, the same thing that everyone else who has ever done anything like this does because it is their pride and this is the reason they are doing it in the first place. It is for their pride [...] they will never admit."
